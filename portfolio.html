			<h2> Girls Who Code </h2>
			<p> For the summer of 2016, I'm part of the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Intuit,
			 where I get to work with 20 girls who all share a passion for coding and using code to change the world.</p>
			 <p> Here is the group of girls who worked with me this summer <small>(click a picture to see more pics)</small>:</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>I've made many things in just 4 weeks. You can run the attached files to see how they work.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class = "p"> I made a <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/114605703/" target = "_blank">dice game</a> that can be played with either one or two players.</li>
				<img src = "piggame.png">
				<li class = "p"> I also made a <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/116316032/" target="_blank">jukebox</a> that allows you to play different songs in any order you choose.</li>
				<img src = "jukebox.png">
				<li class = "p"> Here's a <a href = "runner_game_me.py" target = "_blank">game</a> I made, where the player moves through a city while trying to collect coins and avoid the skulls: </li>
				<img src= "cityscroll.png" style = "width:602px;height:395px;" onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)">
				<li class = "p">I also made a <a href= obamicon.py target = "_blank">program</a> that converts any picture into one that looks like this:</li>
				<img src = "leslie.jpg" style = "width:278px;height:324px;margin-right:20px">
				<img src = "arrow.jpg" style = "width:156px; height:156px">
				<img src = "lesliecon.jpg" style = "width:278px;height:324px;">
				<li class = "p">I also created a <a href = "snowanimation.py" target = "_blank">program</a> that makes it snow on any image:</li>
				<img src = "snowpic.png" style = "width:651px;height:400px;">
